    "## Concept of Cloud Computing\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is cloud computing? \n",
    "Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services - including **servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence** over the internet (\"the cloud\") to offer **faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Services offered by cloud computing providers \n",
    "Typically, these services include:\n",
    "- Compute power - such as Linux servers or web applications.\n",
    "    - Computing choices: VM, containers such as Docker (without operating system), and serverless computing such as function (without server)\n",
    "- Storage - such as files and databases.\n",
    "- Networking - such as secure connections between the cloud provider and your company.\n",
    "- Analytics - such as visualizing telemetry and performance data."

    "\n",
    "### Describe the benefits and considerations of using cloud services\n",
    "- Describe terms such as High Availability, Scalability, Elasticity, Agility, Fault Tolerance, and Disaster Recovery\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **High availability**. The ability to **keep services up and running** for long periods of time, with very little downtime, depending on the service in question.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Scalability**. The ability to **increase or decrease resources for any given workload**. You can add additional resources to service a workload (known as ***scaling out***), or add additional capabilities to manage an increase in demand to the existing resource (known as ***scaling up***). Scalability doesn't have to be done automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Elasticity**. The ability to ***automatically*** **or dynamically increase or decrease resources as needed**. Elastic resources match the current needs, and resources are added or removed automatically to meet future needs when itâ€™s needed (and from the most advantageous geographic location). A distinction between scalability and elasticity is that elasticity is done ***automatically***.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Agility**. The ability to **react quickly**. Cloud services can allocate and deallocate resources quickly. They are provided on-demand via self-service, so vast amounts of computing resources can be provisioned in minutes. There is no manual intervention in provisioning or deprovisioning services.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Fault tolerance**. The ability to **remain up and running even in the event of a component (or service) no longer functioning**. Typically, **redundancy** is built into cloud services architecture, so if one component fails, a backup component takes its place. This type of service is said to be tolerant of faults.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Disaster recovery**. The ability to **recover from an event which has taken down a cloud service**. Cloud services disaster recovery can happen very quickly, with automation and services being readily available to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Describe the principles of economies of scale\n",
    "    \n",
    "    The concept of economies of scale is the ability to **reduce costs** and **gain efficiency** when **operating at a larger scale** in comparison to operating at a smaller scale.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "- Describe the differences between Capital Expenditure (CapEx) and Operational Expenditure (OpEx)\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Capital Expenditure (CapEx): This is the **up front spending of money on physical infrastructure**, and then **deducting that up front expense over time**. The up front cost from CapEx has a value that reduces over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Operational Expenditure (OpEx): This is **spending money on services or products now and being billed for them now**. You can **deduct this expense in the same year you spend it**. There is no up front cost, as you pay for a service or product as you use it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Describe the consumption-based model\n",
    "\n",
    "    Users only pay for the resources that they use.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Describe the differences between Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Describe Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS)\n",
    "\n",
    "    IaaS requires the most user management of all the cloud services. The user is responsible for managing the **operating systems, data, and applications**. With IaaS, you **rent IT infrastructure servers and virtual machines (VMs), storage, networks, and operating systems** from a cloud provider on a pay-as-you-go basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "    When using IaaS, ensuring that a service is up and running is a shared responsibility: the cloud provider is responsible for ensuring the cloud infrastructure is functioning correctly; the cloud customer is responsible for ensuring the service they are using is configured correctly, is up to date, and is available to their customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Describe Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS)\n",
    "\n",
    "    PaaS requires less user management. The cloud provider manages the operating systems, and the user is responsible for the **applications and data** they run and store. **PaaS is a complete development and deployment environment in the cloud**, with resources that enable organizations to deliver everything from simple cloud-based apps to sophisticated cloud-enabled enterprise applications. (Ex: web application, Excel macro, analytics, business intelligence)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Describe Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)\n",
    "\n",
    "    SaaS requires the least amount of management. The cloud provider is responsible for managing everything, and the end user just **uses the software**. It allows users to connect to and use cloud-based apps over the internet. Common examples are email, calendars, and office tools such as Microsoft 365.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Compare and contrast the three different service types\n",
    "\n",
    "    **IaaS** is the most flexible category of cloud services. It aims to give you complete control over the hardware that runs your application. Instead of buying hardware, with IaaS, you rent it. With **PaaS**, users can gain access to more cutting-edge development tools and toolsets. Users can also focus on application development only, as all platform management is handled by the cloud provider. **SaaS** is usually based on an architecture where one version of the application is used for all customers, and licensed through a monthly or annual subscription\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Describe the differences between Public, Private and Hybrid cloud models\n",
    "- Describe Public cloud\n",
    "\n",
    "    A public cloud is **owned by the cloud services provider (also known as a hosting provider)**. It provides resources and services to multiple organizations and users, who connect to the cloud service via a secure network connection, typically over the internet.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Describe Private cloud\n",
    "\n",
    "    A private cloud is **owned and operated by the organization that uses the resources from that cloud**. They create a cloud environment in their own datacenter and provide self-service access to compute resources to users within their organization. The organization remains the owner, entirely responsible for the operation of the services they provide.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Describe Hybrid cloud\n",
    "\n",
    "    A hybrid cloud combines both public and private clouds, allowing you to run your applications in the most appropriate location. **Specific resources run or are used in a public cloud, and others run or are used in a private cloud.** An example of a hybrid cloud usage scenario would be **hosting a website in the public cloud and linking it to a highly secure database hosted in a private cloud**.\n",

    "### Describe the core Azure architectural components\n",
    "- Describe Regions\n",
    "\n",
    "    A **region** is a geographical area on the planet **containing at least one, but potentially multiple datacenters** that are in close proximity and networked together with a low-latency network. Azure intelligently **assigns and controls the resources within each region to ensure workloads are appropriately balanced**. A few examples of regions are West US, Canada Central, West Europe, Australia East, and Japan West. At the time of writing this, Azure is generally available in 60 regions and available in 140 countries.\n",
    "\n",
    "    *Note: A country can have several regions -> a region belongs to a country*\n",
    "\n",
    "    Azure divides the world into **geographies** that are defined by geopolitical boundaries or country borders. An Azure geography  is a discrete market typically containing two or more regions that preserves **data residency and compliance boundaries**. Each region belongs to a single geography and has **specific service availability, compliance, and data residency/sovereignty rules** applied to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "    *Note: Geographies are defined to follow the law and regulations. In general, a geography is a country.*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Describe Availability Zones\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Availability sets** are a way for you to ensure your application remains online if a **high-impact maintenance event** is required, or if a **hardware failure** occurs. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    **Availability zones** are physically separate locations within an **Azure region** that use availability sets to **provide additional fault tolerance**. **(Available sets are duplicated across available zones. Azure region consists of multiple availability zones, which include one or more or data centers.)** Each availability zone is an isolation boundary **containing one or more datacenters** equipped with independent power, cooling, and networking. The availability zones are typically connected to each other through very fast, private fiber-optic networks.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    (Note: One region contains multiple availability zones. One availability zone contains one or more data centers.)\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Knowledge check: Microsoft Azure datacenters are organized and made available by regions.**\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "- Describe Resource Groups\n",
    "\n",
    "    A **resource group** is a unit of management for your resources in Azure. You can think of your resource group as a container that allows you to aggregate and manage all the resources required for your application in a single manageable unit. This allows you to **manage the application collectively over its lifecycle**, rather than manage components individually. Before any resource can be provisioned, you need a resource group for it to be placed in.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Remember that when you delete a resource group you delete all resources contained within it.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Considerations:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Each resource must exist in one, and only one, resource group.\n",
    "    - A resource group can contain resources that **reside in different regions**.\n",
    "    - Resources for an application do not need to exist in the same resource group. However, it is recommended that you keep them in the same resource group for ease of management.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Describe Azure Resource Manager](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/overview)\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Azure Resource Manager**  is a management layer in which resource groups and all the resources within it are created, configured, managed, and deleted. It provides a consistent management layer which allows you to automate the deployment and configuration of resources using different automation and scripting tools, such as Microsoft Azure PowerShell, Azure Command-Line Interface (Azure CLI), Azure portal, REST API, and client SDKs.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    With Azure Resource Manager, you can:\n",
    "    - Deploy Application resources\n",
    "    - Organize resources\n",
    "    - Control access and resources.\n",

    "### Describe some of the core products available in Azure\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note 1: Categories of Azure core products:* ***Azure Compute, Azure Network, Azure Storage, Azure Databases, and Azure Marketplace.***\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note 2: Storage and database are two different concepts in Azure.*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Describe products available for Compute such as Virtual Machines, Virtual Machine Scale Sets, App Services, Azure Container Instances (ACI) and Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Virtual machines (VMs)** are **software emulations of physical computers**. They include a virtual processor, memory, storage, and networking resources. VMs host an operating system, and you're able to install and run software just like a physical computer. *When using a remote desktop client, you can use and control the virtual machine as if you were sitting in front it.*\n",
    "  \n",
    "    - A **network interface** enables an Azure Virtual Machine to communicate with internet, Azure, and on-premises resources. When creating a virtual machine using the Azure portal, the portal creates one network interface with default settings for you. You may instead choose to create network interfaces with custom settings and add one or more network interfaces to a virtual machine when you create it.\n",
    "    \n",
    "        [This article](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-network-interface) explains how to create a network interface with custom settings, change existing settings, such as **network filter (network security group) assignment**, **subnet assignment**, DNS server settings, and IP forwarding, and delete a network interface.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        A network interface can be associated to:\n",
    "            \n",
    "        - A subnet (network)\n",
    "        - A application security group (network security)\n",
    "        - A network security group (network security)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Virtual machine scale sets** are an Azure compute resource that you can use to **deploy and manage a set of identical VMs**. With all VMs configured the same, virtual machine scale sets are designed to support true **autoscale**; no pre-provisioning of VMs is required; and as such makes it easier to build large-scale services targeting big compute, big data, and containerized workloads.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. With **App services** , you can quickly build, deploy, and scale enterprise-grade web, mobile, and API **apps** running on any platform. App Services is a platform as a service ***(PaaS)*** offering.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Azure Functions** are ideal when you're concerned only about the code running your service and not the underlying platform or infrastructure. They're commonly used when you need to **perform work in response to an event** (often via a REST request), timer, or message from another Azure service, and when that work can be completed quickly, within seconds or less.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **If you wish to run multiple instances of an application on a single host machine, *containers* are an excellent choice. Containers are a *virtualization environment.*** (Note: Think of containers as an environment that allows all types of applications to run, no matter what kind of os the applications require.)\n",
    "\n",
    "    - ***Containers*** reference **the operating system of the *host environment*** that runs the container.\n",
    "        - *Note: Containers host one or more containerized apps, which is also called containers. Containers (operating system) host containers (apps) - very confusing.*\n",
    "    - Unlike virtual machines you **do not manage the operating system**.\n",
    "    - Containers are lightweight and are designed to be created, scaled out, and stopped dynamically.\n",
    "    - Containers allows you to respond to changes on demand and quickly restart in case of a crash or hardware interruption.\n",
    "    - Azure supports Docker containers.\n",
    "\n",
    "    There are two ways to manage both **Docker** and **Microsoft-based containers** in Azure.\n",
    "\n",
    "        5.1 **Azure Container Instances** offers the fastest and simplest way to run a container in Azure without having to manage any virtual machines or adopt any additional services. It is a ***PaaS*** offering that allows you to upload your containers, which it will run for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "        5.2 The task of **automating, managing, and interacting with a large number of containers** is known as ***orchestration***. **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)** is a complete orchestration service for containers with distributed architectures and large volumes of containers. Orchestration is the task of automating and managing a large number of containers and how they interact.\n",
    "\n",
    "    **You can move existing applications to containers and run them within AKS.**\n",
    "\n",
    "    **VM vs Containers**\n",
    "\n",
    "    VM can only run one operating system at a time. VM emulates a full computer, so tasks are pretty slow. There's a lighter-weight solution that solves the issue: containers. A container ***bundles a single app and its dependancies***, referred to as containeizing the app, and deploys it as a unit to a *container host*.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The container host provides a ***standardized runtime environment***, which ***abstracts away the operating system and infrastructure requirements***, allowing the containerized application to run side-by-side with other containerized apps.\n",
    "\n",
    "    **VM virtulizes the hardware, while containers virtulize the operating system. The operating system level virtualization of containers allows you to run multiple lightweight containers on a single host without sacrificing the isolation that the virtual machine originally offered.**\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "#### [IMPORTANT!!] Describe products available for Networking such as Virtual Network, Load Balancer, VPN Gateway, Application Gateway and Content Delivery Network\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note: **Network** and **Network Security** are two different concepts.*\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "1. **[Azure Virtual Network](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-networks-overview)** enables **many types of Azure resources** such as Azure VMs to securely **communicate with each other, the internet, and on-premises networks**. A virtual network is **scoped to a single region**; however, multiple virtual networks from different regions can be connected using **virtual network peering**. With Azure Virtual Network you can provide isolation, segmentation, communication with on-premises and cloud resources, routing and filtering of network traffic.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Subnets**: Subnets enable you to **segment the virtual network** into one or more sub-networks and allocate a portion of the virtual network's **address space** to each subnet. *You can then deploy Azure resources in a specific subnet.* Just like in a traditional network, subnets allow you to segment your VNet address space into segments that are appropriate for the organization's internal network. This also **improves address allocation efficiency**. You can secure resources within subnets using Network Security Groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **[Azure Load Balancer](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/load-balancer/load-balancer-overview)** can **provide scale** for your applications and create high availability for your services. *Load balancing* refers to evenly distributing load (incoming network traffic) across a group of backend resources or servers. Load Balancer **supports inbound and outbound scenarios**, provides **low latency and high throughput**, and scales up to millions of flows for all Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP) applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. A **[VPN gateway](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-about-vpngateways)** is a specific type of *virtual network gateway* that is used to send **encrypted traffic** between an **Azure Virtual Network** and an **on-premises location** over the public internet. You can also use a VPN gateway to send encrypted traffic between Azure virtual networks over the Microsoft network.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - A *virtual network gateway* is composed of two or more VMs that are deployed to a specific subnet you create called the gateway subnet.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **[Azure Application Gateway](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/application-gateway/overview)** is a **web traffic load balancer** that enables you to manage traffic to your ***web applications***. It is **the connection through which users connect to your application**. Traditional load balancers operate at the transport layer (OSI layer 4 - TCP and UDP) and **route traffic** based on source IP address and port, to a destination IP address and port.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Application Gateway can make routing decisions based on additional attributes of an **HTTP request**, for example URI path or host headers. For example, you can route traffic based on the incoming URL. So if `/images` is in the incoming URL, you can route traffic to a specific set of servers (known as a pool) configured for images. If `/video` is in the URL, that traffic is routed to another pool that's optimized for videos.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. A **Content Delivery Network (CDN)** is a distributed network of servers that can efficiently **deliver web content to users**. Typical usage scenarios include web applications containing multimedia content, a product launch event in a region, or any event where you expect a high bandwidth requirement in a region.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **[Azure Traffic Manager](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/traffic-manager/traffic-manager-overview)** is a DNS-based traffic load balancer that enables you to distribute traffic optimally to services across global Azure regions, while providing high availability and responsiveness.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The *Domain Name System (DNS)* is a hierarchical and decentralized naming system for computers, services, or other resources connected to the Internet or a private network. It associates various information with domain names assigned to each of the participating entities. (Wikipedia)\n",
    "        \n",
    "    Traffic Manager uses DNS to direct client requests to the most appropriate service endpoint based on a traffic-routing method and the health of the endpoints. An endpoint is any Internet-facing service hosted inside or outside of Azure. Traffic Manager provides a range of traffic-routing methods and endpoint monitoring options to suit different application needs and automatic failover models. Traffic Manager is resilient to failure, including the failure of an entire Azure region.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Describe products available for Storage such as Blob Storage, Disk Storage, File Storage, and Archive Storage\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Disk storage** provides disks **for virtual machines, applications, and other services** to access and use as they need, similar to how they would in on-premises scenarios. Disk storage allows data to be persistently stored and accessed from an attached **virtual hard disk**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Azure Blob storage** is Microsoft's object storage solution for the cloud. Blob storage is optimized for storing massive amounts of **unstructured data, such as text or binary data**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Azure Files** enables you to set up highly available network **file shares** that can be accessed by using the standard Server Message Block (SMB) protocol. That means that **multiple VMs can share the same files** with both read and write access. You can also read the files using the REST interface or the storage client libraries. One thing that distinguishes Azure Files from files on a corporate file share is that **you can access the files from anywhere in the world using a URL** that points to the file and includes a **shared access signature (SAS) token**. You can generate SAS tokens; they allow specific access to a private asset for a specific amount of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The **Azure Queue** service is used to **store and retrieve messages**. Queue messages can be up to 64 KB in size, and a queue can contain millions of messages. Queues are generally used to store lists of messages to be processed asynchronously.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Azure Table** storage stores large amounts of structured data. The service is a NoSQL datastore which accepts authenticated calls from inside and outside the Azure cloud. Azure tables are ideal for storing **structured, *non-relational* data**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Describe products available for Databases such as Cosmos DB, Azure SQL Database, Azure Database for MySQL, Azure Database for PostgreSQL, Azure Database Migration service\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Microsoft Azure Cosmos DB** is a **globally distributed database service** that enables you to **elastically and independently scale throughput and storage across any number of Azure's geographic regions**. It supports **schema-less data** that lets you build highly responsive and Always On applications to support constantly changing data\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Azure SQL Database** is a relational database as a service (***DaaS***) based on the latest stable version of Microsoft SQL Server database engine.\n",
    "    - *Note: Microsoft Azure Cosmos DB is globally distributed; Azure SQL Database is just a regular database.*\n",
    "\n",

    "At this layer, the focus is on **limiting network connectivity across all your resources** to only allow what is required. Segment your resources and use network-level controls to restrict communication to only what is needed. By restricting connectivity, you reduce the risk of lateral movement throughout your network from an attack. Use **NSGs** to create rules about inbound and outbound communication at this layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Combine services\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also combine multiple Azure networking and security services to **manage your network security and provide increased layered protection**. The following are examples of combined services:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Network security groups and Azure Firewall.** *Azure Firewall complements network security group functionality.* Together, they provide better defense-in-depth network security. Network security groups provide distributed network layer traffic filtering to limit traffic to resources within virtual networks in each subscription. Azure Firewall is a fully stateful, centralized network ***firewall-as-a-service***, which provides network and application-level protection across different subscriptions and virtual networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Application Gateway WAF and Azure Firewall.** WAF is a feature of Application Gateway that provides your web applications with centralized, inbound protection *against common exploits and vulnerabilities*. Azure Firewall provides inbound protection for non-HTTP/S protocols (for example, RDP, SSH, FTP), outbound network-level protection for all ports and protocols, and application-level protection for outbound HTTP/S.

    "**Azure Policy** is a service in Azure that you use to create, assign, and, manage policies. These policies enforce different **rules and effects over your resources**, so those resources **stay compliant with your corporate standards and service-level agreements (SLAs)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Azure Policy does this by using policies and initiatives. It runs evaluations of your resources and scans for those not compliant with the policies you have created. For example, you can have a policy to allow only a certain stock keeping unit (SKU) size of virtual machines (VMs) in your environment. *Once you implement this policy, it will **evaluate resources** when you create new ones or update existing ones. It will also evaluate your existing resources.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Azure Policy comes with a number of built-in policy and initiative definitions that you can use, under categories such as **Storage, Networking, Compute, Security Center, and Monitoring**.\n",

    "Azure Policy can also integrate with **Azure DevOps**, by applying any continuous integration and delivery pipeline policies that apply to the pre-deployment and post-deployment of your applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Azure Policy also can **automatically remediate resources and configurations that are deemed non-compliant**, thus ensuring the integrity of the state of the resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three steps to creating and implementing an Azure policy.\n",

    "- **Create a policy definition**: A policy definition expresses what to evaluate and what action to take. For example, you could prevent VMs from being deployed if they are exposed to a public IP address.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Assign a definition to a scope of resources**: To implement your policy definitions, you **assign them to resources**. A policy assignment is a policy definition that has been assigned to take place within a specific scope. This specific scope could range from a management group to a resource group. **Policy assignments are inherited by all child resources.** This means that if a policy is applied to a resource group, it is applied to all the resources within that resource group. However, you can exclude a subscope from the policy assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Review the policy evaluation results**: When a condition is evaluated against your existing resources it is marked *compliant or non-compliant*. You can review the non-compliant policy results and take any action that is needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "An **initiative definition** is **a set of policy definitions** to help track your compliance state for a larger goal. Like a policy assignment, an initiative assignment is an initiative definition assigned to a specific scope. **Initiative assignments** reduce the need to make several initiative definitions for each scope. This scope could also range from a management group to a resource group. \n",

    "- **Azure Resource Manager** is the **deployment and management service** for Azure. It provides **a management layer** that enables you to create, update, and delete resources in your Azure account. You use management features, like access control, locks, and tags, to secure and organize your resources after deployment.\n",

    "- To learn about **[Azure Resource Manager templates](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/overview)**, see Template deployment overview.\n",
    "\n",
    "    To implement infrastructure as code for your Azure solutions, use Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates. **The template is a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) file** that defines the infrastructure and configuration for your project. The template uses declarative syntax, which lets you state what you intend to deploy without having to write the sequence of programming commands to create it. In the template, you specify the resources to deploy and the properties for those resources.\n",

    "\n",
    "Simplify largescale Azure deployments by **packaging key environment artifacts**, such as **Azure Resource Manager templates, role-based access controls, resource groups, and policies**, in a single blueprint definition. *Easily apply the blueprint to new subscriptions and environments, and fine-tune control and management through versioning.*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Azure Blueprints** enable cloud architects to define a repeatable set of Azure resources that implement and adhere to an organization's standards, patterns, and requirements. Azure Blueprint enables development teams to rapidly build and deploy new environments with the knowledge that they're building **within organizational compliance** with a set of built-in components that speed up development and delivery.\n",
    "\n",
    "Azure Blueprints and other Azure governance services are free for managing Azure services\n",

    "3. Track the blueprint assignments.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Azlure Blueprints vs. Azure Resource Manager Templates\n",
    "\n",
    "Azure Blueprints are different from Azure Resource Manager Templates. When Azure Resource Manager Templates deploy resources, they have no active relationship with the deployed resources (they exist in a local environment or in source control). By contrast, with Azure Blueprint, each deployment is tied to an Azure Blueprint package. **This means that the relationship with resources will be maintained, even after deployment. Maintaining relationships, in this way, improves auditing and tracking capabilities.**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Define Subscription Governance\n",
    "\n",
    "There are mainly three aspects to consider in relation to creating and managing subscriptions: **Billing, Access Control, and [Subscription limits](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/azure-subscription-service-limits)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to raise the limit or quota above the default limit, **open an online customer support request at no charge**. The terms soft limit and hard limit often are used informally to describe the current, adjustable limit (soft limit) and the maximum limit (hard limit). If a limit isn't adjustable, there won't be a soft limit, only a hard limit."
